# The verophi binary is built ahead of time (goreleaser / make docker: CGO_ENABLED=0,
# static, no -buildmode=pie) and copied in. No build stage, so the image ships the
# exact artifact that is released. TARGETARCH selects the matching prebuilt binary,
# so a single buildx invocation produces a linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 manifest.
